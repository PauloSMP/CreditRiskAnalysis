# CreditRiskAnalysis
A comprehensive machine learning project aimed at predicting loan default risk using various models such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and Neural Networks. The goal is to enhance credit risk assessment by accurately identifying potential bad payers.

## Project Structure

1. **Database Setup:**

Navigate to the Database folder and restore the PostgreSQL database to set up the required data infrastructure.

2. **Data Upload:**

Run DataScience_Project.py to upload the data into the database and prepare it for analysis.

3. **Data Cleaning and EDA:**

Execute DataCleaning_EDA.py to clean the data and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA). This script will handle missing values, outliers, and provide insights into the dataset.

4. **Model Training and Predictions:**

Open the Models folder to find and run various machine learning models for loan default prediction:
  
  ML_Models.py: Includes implementations of Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost.
  
  ML_Models2_ANN.py: Features an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model for a deep learning approach.

### Additional Information
  **Each Python script is thoroughly commented to guide you through the code. For a more detailed understanding of each step, refer to the comments within the .py files.** 
  **The project aims to strike a balance between traditional machine learning techniques and modern neural network approaches, providing a holistic view of model performance in credit risk analysis.**
